Initially, I thought of creating a library that will introduce a unified way of using queues in different architectures.
There are plenty of libraries like this in C# like MassTransit, NServiceBus, CAP etc.
Thinking more about this option, I wasn't sure that I actually wanted to create a unified language for using all message queuing solutions as they give different features to deal with message routing.
For example, RabbitMQ uses exchanges to publish and route messages to different queues, this concept doesn't exist in redis and when creating a unified API I would need to somehow abstract exchanges out of it.
